Introduction to Python for Bioinformatics provides an introduction to Python with a focus on learning general programming techniques applied to problems in bioinformatics. The expectation is that you will be using Python for manipulating bioinformatics data formats and the output of bioinformatics commands. The material here should be suitable if you are a beginner in programming and Python is your first (or second) language.

We will be using the [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) and its associated "notebooks" as a programming environment. Lessons will be delivered using a combination of web
materials and videos, with opportunity to discuss exercises and their answers provided as time permits. Before starting the course, ensure that your Python and JupyterLab desktop environment is configured by following [these instructions](/jupyterlab-setup/).

### Getting Help

To get help with the course, ask questions on the #python channel on SANBI Slack.
